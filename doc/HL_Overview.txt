 High level overview of programm:
 there are main class to read content.xml file and service functions-algorihtms
 to process results. Additionally programm must write outputs to file for quick
 handling in any Text Processor like OpenOffice.

 => open file
   => read content.xml
     => call algorithm function to get statistic
     => write to screen or to file
